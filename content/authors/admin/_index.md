Social learning helps humans and animals rapidly adapt to new circumstances, and drives the emergence of complex learned behaviors. My research is focused on **Social Reinforcement Learning**---developing algorithms that combine insights from social learning and multi-agent training to improve AI agents' [learning](./publication/paired), [generalization](./publication/learning-social-learning/), [coordination](./publication/social-influence-as-intrinsic-motivation-for-multiagent-deep-reinforce/), and [human-AI interaction](./publication/humancentric-dialog-training-via-offline-reinforcement-learning/). 

I am currently a [Senior Research Scientist at Google Brain](https://research.google/people/NatashaJaques/). From 2020-2022 I held this position jointly with a [Visiting Postdoctoral Scholar position at UC Berkeley](http://rail.eecs.berkeley.edu/people.html), in Sergey Levine's group. Before that, I received my [PhD from MIT](publication/social-and-affective-machine-learning/), where I worked on [Affective Computing](./tag/affective-computing) and [deep](./tag/deep-learning)/[reinforcement](./tag/reinforcement-learning)/[machine learning](./tag/machine-learning). For a brief overview of my thesis, check out this [write-up in Computer Vision News](https://www.rsipvision.com/ComputerVisionNews-2021November/42/). I have interned at DeepMind, Google Brain, and worked as an OpenAI Scholars mentor. 

**I will be joining the University of Washington Allen School of Computer Science as an assistant professor starting in January, 2024. If you are interested in joining my lab as a PhD student, please consider applying to UW!** Be sure to mention my name in your application.
